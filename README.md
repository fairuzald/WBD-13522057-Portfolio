## Performance and SEO

The website has been optimized to achieve the following results on **Google PageSpeed Insights**:

- **Mobile**: >97

Additionally, SEO optimizations were implemented to improve visibility and performance, ensuring fast load times and enhanced user experience.

## Key Criteria

This project was developed under the following constraints and challenges:

1. **Semantic HTML**: All elements are marked up using the appropriate semantic tags to ensure clear structure and accessibility for screen readers and SEO.

2. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, including both mobile and desktop views.

3. **Creativity in Colors and Typography**: Custom fonts and a color palette were chosen to reflect personal style, ensuring both aesthetics and readability.

### Bonus Criteria

- **Interactive Design (without JavaScript)**: The site uses only HTML and CSS for any interactions, such as hover effects and transitions, without relying on JavaScript.
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility features were considered to make the site navigable by screen readers and keyboard users.

- **Performance Optimization**: Images, CSS, and HTML were all optimized for fast loading and minimal rendering times.

### Design Decisions

- **Responsive Layout**: The choice to use CSS Flexbox and media queries ensures the site layout remains fluid and adaptable across various devices.
- **Typography & Colors**: A balance between modern fonts and a clean, minimalist color scheme was used to keep the design professional and readable.

- **No Frameworks**: To adhere to the course requirements and push creativity, no frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) or templating engines were used, ensuring everything was coded from scratch.
